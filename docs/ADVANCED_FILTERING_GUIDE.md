## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space/Enter**: Toggle checkboxes
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate list items

## Tips & Tricks

### Efficient Filtering
- Use presets for recurring shopping patterns
- Combine search with category filters for precision
- Use exclude mode to focus on remaining items

### Organizing Large Lists
- Create category-specific presets
- Use custom categories for special occasions
- Hide gotten items to see what's left

### Quick List Management
- Save "Active Items" preset (hide gotten)
- Create "Needs Price" preset (filter unpriced items)
- Use "Fresh First" preset (produce, dairy, meat)

## Filter Persistence

### Per-List Memory
Your filter settings are automatically saved for each list separately. When you switch lists, your preferred filters for that list are restored.

### Filter Presets
Presets are global and work across all lists. They're stored in your browser and persist across sessions.

### Export/Import
Use the filter preferences API to export your presets for backup:

```javascript
import { exportFilterPreferences } from './utils/filterPreferences';
const backup = exportFilterPreferences();
// Save this JSON string
```

## Troubleshooting

**Filters not saving?**
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Ensure you have storage space available

**Frequently used categories empty?**
- Add items to categories and filter by them
- Analytics build over time with usage

**Preset limit reached?**
- Maximum 20 presets supported
- Delete unused presets to make room
- Export presets before deleting

**Filters reset unexpectedly?**
- Check if localStorage was cleared
- Browser incognito mode doesn't persist
- Export presets regularly as backup

## Best Practices

### Naming Presets
- Use descriptive names: "Weekly Produce", not "Filter1"
- Include context: "Holiday Baking", "Meal Prep Mon-Wed"
- Keep names short for mobile display

### Managing Presets
- Delete unused presets regularly
- Export presets before major changes
- Group similar presets with naming conventions

### Category Organization
- Use custom categories for special needs
- Keep category names concise
- Archive unused custom categories

### Performance
- Avoid extremely complex filter combinations
- Clear search text when not needed
- Use category filters instead of many search terms

## Integration with Other Features

### Category Analytics
Filter usage is tracked in category analytics:
- Most filtered categories appear in "Frequently Used"
- Filter patterns inform future suggestions
- Usage data helps optimize your workflow

### List Sharing
Filter preferences are personal:
- Each user has their own filter settings
- Presets aren't shared with list members
- Great for different shopping preferences

### Budget Tracking
Combine filters with budget tracking:
- Filter by category to see category spending
- Use presets to track regular purchases
- Monitor budget per category group

## API Integration

### Programmatic Filter Management

```typescript
import {
  getListFilters,
  saveListFilters,
  getSavedFilters,
  saveFilterPreset,
  applySavedFilter
} from './utils/filterPreferences';

// Get current list filters
const filters = getListFilters('list-123', allCategories);

// Save a new preset
const preset = saveFilterPreset('My Preset', {
  searchText: '',
  showGotten: false,
  categories: ['Produce', 'Dairy'],
  categoryMode: 'include',
  categoryType: 'predefined'
});

// Apply a preset
const applied = applySavedFilter(preset.id);
