## Creating a Backup

### Manual Export

1. Open the Custom Category Manager
2. Click the **"Backup/Restore"** button
3. Click **"Export Backup"** card
4. Your categories are downloaded as a JSON file

**What you get:**
- JSON file with all your categories
- Category names, colors, and icons
- Item counts per category
- Timestamp and list information

**File naming:**
```
categories-my-grocery-list-2024-01-15.json
```

## Restoring from Backup

### Basic Import

1. Open the Custom Category Manager
2. Click **"Backup/Restore"** button
3. Click **"Restore Backup"** card
4. Click **"Choose File"** and select your backup JSON
5. Click **"Preview Import"**
6. Review the categories
7. Click **"Confirm Import"**

**That's it!** Your categories are restored.

## Using Automatic Backups

### How It Works

Categories are automatically backed up to your browser:
- After adding a category
- After updating a category
- After deleting categories
- Stores last 5 backups per list

### Viewing Backup History

1. Open **Backup/Restore** dialog
2. Click **"Backup History"** card
3. See all automatic backups with:
   - List name
   - Date and time
   - Number of categories

### Restoring from History

1. Find the backup you want
2. Click **"Restore"** button
3. Confirm the restore
4. Done!

## Handling Conflicts

When importing, you might have categories with the same name. Choose how to handle them:

### Skip (Recommended)
- **What it does**: Keeps your existing categories, skips duplicates
- **Use when**: You want to be safe and not overwrite anything
- **Example**: You have "Organic" already, importing won't change it

### Overwrite
- **What it does**: Replaces existing categories with imported ones
- **Use when**: Restoring your own backup and want exact copy
- **Example**: You have "Organic" (red), importing makes it green (from backup)

### Rename
- **What it does**: Imports as new categories with "(Imported)" suffix
- **Use when**: You want to keep both versions
- **Example**: You have "Organic", importing creates "Organic (Imported)"

### Merge
- **What it does**: Updates color/icon of existing categories
- **Use when**: You want to update properties but keep names
- **Example**: You have "Organic" (red), importing updates it to green

## Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Regular Exports
Export your categories monthly and keep the files. It's your safety net!

### Tip 2: Naming Convention
When exporting manually, add a note to the filename:
```
categories-grocery-BEFORE-CLEANUP-2024-01-15.json
```

### Tip 3: Check Automatic Backups
Glance at backup history occasionally to ensure auto-backup is working.

### Tip 4: Clean Old Backups
Delete old automatic backups you don't need to save browser storage.

### Tip 5: Preview Before Import
Always preview imports to see what will happen before confirming.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid backup file format"

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you selected a JSON file
- Check the file isn't corrupted
- Try exporting a fresh backup and compare formats

### Problem: Import does nothing

**Solutions:**
- Check you clicked "Confirm Import" (not just "Preview")
- Verify conflict resolution is selected
- Look for error messages at top of dialog

### Problem: Categories are duplicated

**Solutions:**
- You likely used "Rename" resolution
- Delete the duplicates manually
- Or restore from backup with "Overwrite"

### Problem: Lost automatic backups

**Solutions:**
- Check if browser data was cleared
- Automatic backups are browser-specific (not synced)
- Keep manual exports for important backups

## Configuration

### Adjusting Automatic Backups

1. Click **"Backup/Restore"**
2. Click **"Settings"** card
3. Configure:
   - **Enable automatic backups**: Toggle on/off
   - **Maximum backups to keep**: 1-10 (default: 5)
4. Click **"Save Settings"**

**Recommendations:**
- Keep auto-backup enabled
- Use 5 backups for normal use
- Use 10 if you change categories frequently

---

## Best Practices

1. **Export before major changes**
   - Deleting multiple categories
   - Bulk color changes
   - Merging categories

2. **Name your exports descriptively**
   - Include the date
   - Add a note about what it contains

3. **Store backups safely**
   - Cloud storage
   - Email to yourself
   - USB drive

4. **Test imports**
   - Try importing in a test list first
   - Verify it works as expected
   - Then use in production

5. **Review before confirming**
   - Check preview carefully
   - Understand conflict resolution
   - Count expected imports
