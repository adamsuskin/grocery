**Application:** Grocery List Manager - Multi-User Features
**Scope:** List sharing, permissions, and multi-user operations

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on the list sharing and multi-user features of the Grocery List Manager application. The audit covered authentication, authorization, database security, client-side security, and rate limiting mechanisms.

**Overall Security Posture:** GOOD

The application demonstrates strong security practices with proper authentication, authorization checks, SQL injection protection, and comprehensive rate limiting. Several areas of excellence were identified, along with recommendations for further hardening.

---

## 1. Authentication Security

### ✅ Strengths

1. **JWT Implementation**
   - Secure token generation using `jsonwebtoken` library
   - Access tokens with 15-minute expiration
   - Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration
   - Proper token signing with secret keys from environment variables

2. **Password Security**
   - Passwords hashed using `bcrypt` with 10 rounds
   - Strong password requirements enforced:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - Uppercase and lowercase letters required
     - Numbers required
     - Password validation on both client and server

3. **Token Storage**
   - Client-side tokens stored in localStorage
   - Tokens cleared on logout
   - Token refresh mechanism implemented
   - Proactive token refresh before expiration

4. **Authentication Middleware**
   - `authenticateToken` middleware on all protected routes
   - Token format validation
   - Token expiration checking
   - Proper error responses (401 Unauthorized)

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **HttpOnly Cookies for Refresh Tokens**
   - Consider moving refresh tokens from localStorage to HttpOnly cookies
   - This prevents XSS attacks from stealing refresh tokens
   - Implementation: Set refresh token as HttpOnly cookie in login/register endpoints

2. **Token Rotation**
   - Implement refresh token rotation (new refresh token on each refresh)
   - Invalidate old refresh tokens after use
   - Detect potential token theft through token reuse

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (Future)**
   - Consider implementing optional 2FA for enhanced security
   - TOTP-based authentication recommended

---

## 2. Authorization Security

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Permission-Based Access Control**
   - Three distinct permission levels: `owner`, `editor`, `viewer`
   - Permission hierarchy properly enforced
   - Middleware: `checkListOwner`, `checkListEditor`, `checkListViewer`

2. **Ownership Verification**
   - All list operations check list membership
   - Owner permissions required for:
     - List deletion
     - Member management
     - List settings modification
     - Invite link generation
   - Editor permissions required for:
     - Item CRUD operations
   - Viewer permissions required for:
     - Viewing list and items

3. **Resource Access Validation**
   - Every endpoint validates:
     - User is authenticated (`authenticateToken`)
     - User is a list member (`checkListViewer/Editor/Owner`)
     - List exists before operations
   - Cannot access other users' lists
   - Cannot modify resources without proper permissions

4. **Member Management Security**
   - Only owners can add/remove members
   - Cannot remove list owner
   - Owner cannot leave list (must transfer ownership or delete)
   - Proper validation on member operations

### ✅ Test Coverage

All authorization scenarios tested:
- Non-members cannot access lists
- Viewers cannot edit items
- Editors cannot manage members
- Ownership transfer requires confirmation
- Cross-user access properly blocked

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Audit Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive audit logs for:
     - Permission changes
     - Member additions/removals
     - Failed authorization attempts
   - Store audit logs in separate table with retention policy

2. **Ownership Transfer Safeguards**
   - Add email confirmation for ownership transfer
   - Implement cooldown period before transfer completes
   - Notify all members of ownership changes

---

## 3. SQL Injection Protection

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Parameterized Queries**
   - ALL database queries use parameterized statements
   - No string concatenation for SQL queries
   - PostgreSQL `$1, $2, $3` placeholders used consistently

2. **Example Safe Queries**
   ```typescript
   // List access check
   await pool.query(
     'SELECT * FROM list_members WHERE list_id = $1 AND user_id = $2',
     [listId, userId]
   );

   // User search with LIKE
   await pool.query(
     'SELECT id, email, name, created_at FROM users
      WHERE LOWER(email) LIKE LOWER($1) AND id != $2',
     [`%${email}%`, currentUserId]
   );

   // Dynamic updates with parameterized values
   const updates = [];
   const values = [];
   let paramCount = 1;
   if (name) {
     updates.push(`name = $${paramCount++}`);
     values.push(name);
   }
   ```

3. **Input Validation**
   - UUIDs validated using `express-validator`
   - Email format validated
   - Enum types validated for permissions
   - Length limits on text fields

### ✅ Risk Assessment

**SQL Injection Risk:** MINIMAL

All queries properly parameterized with no identified vulnerabilities.

---

## 4. Row-Level Security

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Multi-Layer Security Checks**
   - Middleware checks user is list member
   - Controllers verify list existence
   - Double-check ownership for sensitive operations

2. **List Membership Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Step 1: Check list exists
   const listResult = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM lists WHERE id = $1', [id]);

   // Step 2: Check user is member
   const memberResult = await pool.query(
     'SELECT * FROM list_members WHERE list_id = $1 AND user_id = $2',
     [listId, userId]
   );

   // Step 3: Check permission level
   if (userPermission < requiredPermission) {
     throw new AuthorizationError('Insufficient permissions');
   }
   ```

3. **Transaction Safety**
   - Database transactions used for multi-step operations
   - Rollback on errors
   - Atomic ownership transfers
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     const client = await pool.connect();
     try {
       await client.query('BEGIN');
       // Multiple operations...
       await client.query('COMMIT');
     } catch (error) {
       await client.query('ROLLBACK');
       throw error;
     }
     ```

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Database Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Consider implementing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security policies
   - Example policy:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE lists ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

     CREATE POLICY list_access_policy ON lists
     FOR ALL USING (
       id IN (SELECT list_id FROM list_members WHERE user_id = current_user_id())
     );
     ```

2. **Database Views for Security**
   - Create views that automatically filter by user access
   - Reduces risk of permission bypass in queries

---

## 5. Rate Limiting

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Rate Limiting**
   - Rate limiting implemented for all authentication endpoints
   - IP-based rate limiting using `express-rate-limit`
   - Different limits for different operations:

   | Endpoint | Limit | Window | Purpose |
   |----------|-------|--------|---------|
   | Login | 5 attempts | 15 min | Prevent brute force |
   | Register | 3 attempts | 1 hour | Prevent spam accounts |
   | Password Reset | 3 attempts | 1 hour | Prevent abuse |
   | Token Refresh | 10 attempts | 15 min | Prevent token abuse |
   | User Search | 30 attempts | 15 min | Prevent enumeration |
   | Change Password | 5 attempts | 15 min | Prevent brute force |

2. **Smart IP Detection**
   - Handles proxy headers: `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`, `cf-connecting-ip`
   - Extracts first IP from forwarded chain
   - Falls back to socket remote address

3. **Failed Login Tracking**
   - `checkAccountLockout` middleware tracks failed login attempts
   - Account lockout after multiple failures
   - Prevents credential stuffing attacks

4. **Rate Limit Headers**
   - Standard `RateLimit-*` headers sent
   - `Retry-After` header on 429 responses
   - Clients can implement backoff strategies

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Distributed Rate Limiting**
   - Current implementation uses in-memory storage
   - For production with multiple servers, use Redis for rate limit storage
   - Ensures consistent rate limiting across instances

2. **User-Based Rate Limiting**
   - Add per-user rate limits in addition to IP-based
   - Prevents single user from overwhelming system
   - Especially important for list operations

3. **API Endpoint Rate Limiting**
   - Consider adding rate limits to list/item operations
   - Prevent abuse of search, export, duplicate features
   - Suggested limits:
     - List creation: 10 per hour per user
     - Item creation: 100 per hour per list
     - List duplication: 5 per hour per user

---

## 6. Client-Side Security

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Token Handling**
   - Token validation before use
   - JWT format validation (3 parts separated by dots)
   - Automatic token refresh on expiration
   - Token cleared on logout and errors

2. **No Sensitive Data Leakage**
   - Passwords never stored client-side
   - User data limited to necessary fields
   - API responses properly sanitized
   - Error messages don't expose internal details

3. **Secure API Communication**
   - All API requests over HTTPS (in production)
   - Authorization header properly formatted
   - Content-Type validation
   - CORS properly configured

4. **XSS Prevention**
   - React automatically escapes output
   - No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage found
   - User input sanitized before display

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS
   - Recommended headers:
     ```
     Content-Security-Policy:
       default-src 'self';
       script-src 'self';
       style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
       img-src 'self' data: https:;
     ```

2. **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
   - Use SRI for external CDN resources
   - Ensures scripts haven't been tampered with

3. **localStorage Security**
   - Document risks of localStorage for tokens
   - Consider session storage for more sensitive data
   - Implement token encryption if needed

4. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production
   - Use HSTS headers: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

---

## 7. Invite Link Security

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Secure Token Generation**
   - Uses `nanoid(32)` for invite tokens
   - 32 characters = ~191 bits of entropy
   - Cryptographically secure random generation
   - Very low collision probability

2. **Expiration Control**
   - Invite links expire after configurable period (1-365 days)
   - Default: 7 days
   - Expired links properly rejected
   - Owner can revoke links at any time

3. **Access Control**
   - Only list owners can generate invite links
   - Public endpoint for viewing invite details (limited info)
   - Authentication required to accept invite
   - Cannot join if already a member

4. **Default Permissions**
   - New members added as 'editor' by default
   - Owner can change permissions after joining
   - Prevents privilege escalation

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **One-Time Invite Links**
   - Consider implementing single-use invite links
   - More secure for individual invitations
   - Track invite usage in database

2. **Invite Limits**
   - Rate limit invite link generation per list
   - Prevent spam/abuse scenarios
   - Suggested: 10 invites per hour per list

3. **Email Invitations**
   - Implement direct email invitations
   - More secure than shareable links
   - Can include temporary passwords

---

## 8. Data Validation

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Input Validation Middleware**
   - `express-validator` used for request validation
   - Validation on all input fields
   - Type checking, length limits, format validation

2. **Examples of Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Email validation
   body('email')
     .trim()
     .isEmail()
     .normalizeEmail()

   // UUID validation
   param('id')
     .notEmpty()
     .isUUID()

   // Enum validation
   body('permission')
     .isIn(['owner', 'editor', 'viewer'])

   // Color validation
   body('color')
     .optional()
     .matches(/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$/)
   ```

3. **Error Responses**
   - Validation errors return 400 Bad Request
   - Clear error messages
   - Lists all validation failures

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **File Upload Validation** (if implemented)

   - Use separate storage service (S3, etc.)

2. **API Schema Validation**
   - Consider using JSON Schema for request/response validation
   - OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation and validation

---

## 9. Error Handling

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Custom Error Classes**
   - `NotFoundError`, `AuthorizationError`, `ValidationError`
   - Clear error types for different scenarios
   - Proper HTTP status codes

2. **Error Middleware**
   - Centralized error handling
   - Errors don't expose internal details
   - Stack traces only in development

3. **Consistent Error Format**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Authorization error",
     "message": "Only the list owner can delete the list"
   }
   ```

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Error Monitoring**
   - Implement error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
   - Track security-related errors separately
   - Alert on suspicious patterns

2. **Rate Limit Error Responses**
   - Don't reveal too much in error messages
   - Generic "too many requests" message
   - Log detailed info server-side

---

## 10. Environment Variables & Secrets

### ✅ Current Implementation

1. **Environment Variables Used**
   - `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing key
   - `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - Refresh token signing key
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection
   - `PORT` - Server port
   - `NODE_ENV` - Environment
   - `CLIENT_URL` - Frontend URL for CORS

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Secret Management**
   - Use proper secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Different secrets per environment
   - Never commit secrets to version control

2. **Secret Strength**
   - JWT secrets should be at least 256 bits (32 bytes)
   - Generate using cryptographically secure random function:
     ```bash
     node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
     ```

3. **Environment Validation**
   - Validate all required environment variables on startup
   - Fail fast if secrets are missing or invalid

---

## 11. CORS Configuration

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Strict CORS Policy**
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured for production
   - Whitelist specific origins (not wildcard `*`)
   - Recommended configuration:
     ```typescript
     app.use(cors({
       origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
       credentials: true,
       methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH'],
       allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
     }));
     ```

2. **Preflight Caching**
   - Cache preflight requests to reduce overhead
   - `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` (24 hours)

---

## 12. Database Security

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Connection Security**
   - Database connections properly pooled
   - Connection limits enforced
   - Prepared statements used throughout

2. **Foreign Keys & Constraints**
   - Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity
   - CASCADE deletes for dependent data
   - NOT NULL constraints on critical fields

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Database User Permissions**
   - Application should use limited database user
   - Grant only necessary permissions (no DROP, CREATE)
   - Separate users for different environments

2. **Database Encryption**
   - Enable encryption at rest for database
   - Use SSL/TLS for database connections
   - Connection string should include `sslmode=require`

3. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Regular automated backups
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Encrypted backups stored securely

4. **Database Monitoring**
   - Monitor for suspicious queries
   - Track slow queries
   - Alert on unusual activity patterns

---

## 13. Additional Security Measures

### Recommended Implementations

1. **Security Headers**
   - Use `helmet` middleware for security headers:
     ```typescript
     import helmet from 'helmet';
     app.use(helmet());
     ```
   - Key headers:
     - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (prevent clickjacking)
     - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
     - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
     - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

2. **Request Size Limits**
   - Implement payload size limits to prevent DoS
   ```typescript
   app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));
   app.use(express.urlencoded({ limit: '10mb', extended: true }));
   ```

3. **Brute Force Protection**
   - Already implemented via rate limiting
   - Consider adding progressive delays
   - CAPTCHA after multiple failures

4. **Session Management**
   - Implement session timeout
   - Absolute timeout: 7 days (refresh token expiry)
   - Idle timeout: 15 minutes (access token expiry)

5. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement logging for:
     - Authentication failures
     - Authorization failures
