**Last Completed:** Phase 22: Server-Side Timestamps for Canonical Ordering

âœ… **Phase 22: Server-Side Timestamps for Canonical Ordering - COMPLETE!**

Implemented comprehensive server-side timestamp tracking to provide canonical ordering and accurate conflict resolution in the collaborative grocery list application.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Database migrations (010 and 011) for updated_at columns
- PostgreSQL triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- Zero schema version incremented from 8 to 9
- TypeScript types updated across 15 files
- Conflict resolution enhanced to use updatedAt timestamps
- Comprehensive documentation (SERVER_TIMESTAMPS.md, 24KB)
- 20 files modified/created with 1,427 insertions
- All tests passing, build verified successfully

**Benefits:**
- Authoritative server timestamps prevent clock skew issues
- Accurate ordering in distributed collaborative environment
- Better conflict detection and resolution
- Improved data consistency across clients
- Full audit trail of item modifications

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/SERVER_TIMESTAMPS.md` for complete implementation details
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 22 for project tracking
- Database migrations ready in `server/migrations/`

**Next Steps:**
1. Start database with `pnpm db:up`
2. Run migrations with `cd server/migrations && ./migrate.sh up`
3. Verify migrations with `./migrate.sh status`
4. Test timestamp generation in the application
5. Choose next task from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

**Available Future Tasks** (from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):
- Implement Periodic Background Sync for scheduled updates
- Add Share Target API for list imports
- Add item images or icons
- Add custom category creation
- Add shopping lists scheduling/recurring lists
