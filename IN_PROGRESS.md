## Task: Server-Side Timestamps for Canonical Ordering

**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** Now
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Completion:** 50 subagents

### Description
Implement server-side timestamps to provide canonical ordering for items and resolve conflicts in multi-user collaborative scenarios. This ensures all clients agree on the order of operations regardless of local clock differences.

### Key Objectives
1. Add server-side timestamp generation for all mutations
2. Update database schema to include server_timestamp fields
3. Modify API endpoints to return server timestamps
4. Update Zero sync to use server timestamps for conflict resolution
5. Add database migration for existing data
6. Update TypeScript types
7. Test and verify proper ordering across multiple clients
