## Phase 29: Enhanced Drag & Drop Meal Planner - IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

**Priority:** HIGH
**Assigned:** Claude Agent Instance

### Objective
Implement visual drag and drop functionality for the meal planner to enhance user experience and make meal planning more intuitive and efficient.

### Key Features to Implement

2. **Drag to Reorder Meals Within a Day**
   - Allow reordering meals within the same day
   - Update mealType or custom ordering
   - Maintain smooth animations

3. **Drag to Copy Meals to Multiple Days**

   - Visual indicator showing copy vs move
   - Create duplicates of meal plans

4. **Drag from Recipe List to Calendar**
   - Drag recipes directly from recipe list
   - Drop onto calendar to create meal plan
   - Automatic meal plan creation on drop

5. **Touch-Friendly Mobile Drag and Drop**

1. **Library Selection**
   - Evaluate: react-beautiful-dnd, dnd-kit, react-dnd
   - Choose based on: TypeScript support, mobile compatibility, bundle size

2. **Component Updates**
   - Update MealPlanner.tsx with drag contexts
   - Add drag handles to meal plan items
   - Implement drop zones for calendar days
   - Add visual feedback components

3. **State Management**
   - Handle drag start/end states
   - Update Zero mutations for meal plan changes
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Handle conflicts gracefully
