## Implementing: Add Sorting by Category

**Started:** Now
**Phase:** Future Enhancements
**Status:** In Progress

### Task Description
Add "category" as a sort field option to complement existing sort by name, quantity, and date. This will allow users to group items by their category (Produce, Dairy, Meat, etc.) when viewing their grocery list.

### Implementation Steps
1. Update TypeScript types to add 'category' to SortField union type
2. Update zero-store.ts sorting logic to handle category sorting
3. Update SortControls component to include category sort button
4. Test all sorting combinations (category + asc/desc)
5. Verify TypeScript compilation passes
6. Verify build process passes
7. Update documentation
8. Commit changes

### Files to Modify
- src/types.ts - Add 'category' to SortField type
- src/zero-store.ts - Add category sorting logic
- src/components/SortControls.tsx - Add category sort button
- README.md - Document category sorting
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Mark task as complete

### Expected Outcome
Users can sort their grocery list by category to group similar items together (e.g., all Produce items, then all Dairy items, etc.), making shopping more efficient.
