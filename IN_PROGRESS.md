## Phase 16: Offline Conflict Resolution

**Started:** [Current session]
**Assigned to:** Claude Agent Instance

### Goal
Implement robust offline conflict resolution for the grocery list app to handle scenarios where multiple users edit the same items while offline, then come back online.

### Tasks
- [ ] Research Zero's conflict resolution capabilities and patterns
- [ ] Design conflict resolution strategy (Last-Write-Wins vs Custom Merge)
- [ ] Implement conflict detection system
- [ ] Create ConflictResolver utility class
- [ ] Add offline queue management
- [ ] Implement merge strategies for different field types
- [ ] Create UI components for conflict notification
- [ ] Add user conflict resolution interface
- [ ] Implement automatic conflict resolution for simple cases
- [ ] Add conflict logging and analytics
- [ ] Update Zero store with conflict handlers
- [ ] Add offline indicator to UI
- [ ] Create sync status component
- [ ] Test multi-user offline scenarios
- [ ] Document conflict resolution behavior
- [ ] Update README with offline usage guide

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Detection**: Monitor Zero sync status and detect conflicts
2. **Resolution Strategies**:
   - Automatic: timestamps, non-overlapping fields
   - Manual: show conflict UI for critical changes
3. **User Experience**: Clear indicators, easy conflict resolution UI
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive offline/online scenarios

### Target Completion
Using up to 50 subagents to implement in parallel
