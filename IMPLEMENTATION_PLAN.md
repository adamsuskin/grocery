## Current Status

The application is feature-complete with the following capabilities:
- ✅ Zero client configured and integrated for real-time sync
- ✅ Schema defined for grocery_items table with categories and notes
- ✅ CRUD operations migrated to Zero API
- ✅ React hooks updated to use Zero queries
- ✅ PostgreSQL + zero-cache infrastructure ready
- ✅ Development environment fully documented
- ✅ Search and filter functionality implemented
- ✅ Debounced search for optimal performance
- ✅ Results counter showing filtered items
- ✅ Sorting by name, quantity, and date (ascending/descending)
- ✅ Sort controls with visual feedback (active state)
- ✅ Seamless integration of search, filter, and sort features

**Next Steps to Run:**
1. Start PostgreSQL: `pnpm db:up`
2. Initialize database: `./scripts/init-db.sh`
3. Start zero-cache: `pnpm zero:dev` (in separate terminal)
4. Start app: `pnpm dev`

Or use: `pnpm dev:full` to start everything at once

**Note:** After implementing categories, you may need to drop and recreate the database or run a migration to add the category column to existing records.
