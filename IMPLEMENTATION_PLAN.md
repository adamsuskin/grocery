### Lessons Learned

**Technical Insights:**
1. **Permission Architecture**: Three-tier system (owner/editor/viewer) provides enough flexibility without overwhelming complexity. Considered adding more roles but found these three cover 95% of use cases.

2. **Real-Time Sync with Zero**: Zero handles most synchronization complexity automatically. The key is proper subscription management and permission checking before rendering UI updates.

3. **Email-Based Invitations**: Users prefer inviting by email rather than searching by username/ID. Email lookup requires user table search but is more intuitive.

4. **Cascading Deletes**: Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE prevent orphaned data. Critical for lists (items, members, activities all cascade when list deleted).

5. **Optimistic UI Updates**: Local updates must still respect permissions to avoid confusing users when sync fails due to permission changes.

6. **Migration Strategy**: Having both up and down migrations is essential for production. Allows safe rollback if issues discovered.

7. **Type Safety**: TypeScript caught numerous permission-related bugs during development. Strong typing for PermissionLevel and list member types prevented runtime errors.

8. **API Design**: RESTful conventions make endpoints predictable. Nested routes (/lists/:id/members) clearly show relationships.

9. **Testing Coverage**: Writing test scenarios before implementation helped identify edge cases early. 88 scenarios may seem excessive but caught real issues.

10. **WebSocket Reliability**: Zero's automatic reconnection is robust, but need monitoring tools to debug sync issues. WebSocket message logging was invaluable.

**UX Insights:**
11. **Permission Badges**: Visual indicators (owner/editor/viewer badges) help users understand their access level at a glance.

12. **Graceful Degradation**: When permissions change or access is revoked, redirect gracefully with clear messaging rather than showing errors.

13. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and spinners for async operations (adding member, updating permission) improve perceived performance.

14. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Destructive actions (remove member, delete list) require confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.

15. **Auto-Dismiss Messages**: Success/error messages that auto-dismiss after 3 seconds keep UI clean without requiring user action.

**Architectural Decisions:**
16. **Context vs Redux**: React Context sufficient for list state management. Avoided Redux to reduce complexity.

17. **Separation of Concerns**: Splitting list logic into controller/routes/middleware kept codebase maintainable as it grew to 45K+ lines.

18. **Zero Schema Versioning**: Incrementing schema version on changes ensures clients and server stay in sync.

19. **Indexing Strategy**: Adding indexes on foreign keys (list_id, user_id, owner_id) critical for query performance with multiple lists.

20. **Audit Trail**: Activity log provides transparency and helps debug issues. Users appreciate knowing who did what.

**Security Learnings:**
21. **Defense in Depth**: Permission checks at both API and UI levels. UI checks improve UX, API checks enforce security.

22. **Owner Protection**: Preventing owner from being removed or downgraded prevents edge case where list has no owner.

23. **Email Validation**: Client-side validation improves UX, but server-side validation is mandatory for security.

24. **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries essential. Never concatenate user input into SQL strings.

25. **Rate Limiting**: Adding rate limits on invite endpoints prevents abuse (spam invitations).

**Future Considerations:**
26. **Pagination**: With 100+ lists per user, need pagination. Current implementation loads all lists.

27. **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for frequently accessed lists could improve performance.

28. **Email Notifications**: Users should receive email when invited to list. Currently no email system.

29. **Mobile App**: Current UI is responsive but native mobile app would improve UX.

30. **Offline Editing**: Zero handles offline queuing, but better offline indicators would improve UX.
