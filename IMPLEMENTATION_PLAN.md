cp .env.example .env      # Configure environment variables
pnpm db:up                # Start PostgreSQL
pnpm db:init              # Initialize database with users table
pnpm dev:all              # Start everything (DB + Zero + Auth API + Frontend)
```

**Option 2: Individual Services**
```bash
pnpm db:up                # Start PostgreSQL
pnpm server:dev           # Start auth server (terminal 1)
pnpm zero:dev             # Start zero-cache (terminal 2)
pnpm dev                  # Start frontend (terminal 3)
```

**Default Credentials** (after migration):
- Email: `admin@grocery.local`
- Password: `admin123`
- ⚠️ **CHANGE PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY AFTER FIRST LOGIN!**
