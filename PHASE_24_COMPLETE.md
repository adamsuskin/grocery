- Preview and confirm before adding
- Automatic quantity and category detection
- Smart text parsing reduces errors

### Use Cases
- Friend shares list via WhatsApp → Share to Grocery App
- Recipe website → Share ingredient list
- Email with grocery list → Share to Grocery App
- Notes app with items → Share to Grocery App
- CSV file from meal planner → Share to Grocery App
